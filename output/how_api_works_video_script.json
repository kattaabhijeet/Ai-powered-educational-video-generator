An orange arrow points to the server rectangle, turning into a stylized orange circle labeled \"Endpoint\". Flowchart boxes illustrate \"Method\", \"URL\", \"Parameters\" with cyan connectors.",

An orange arrow returns to the client, turning into a cyan circle labeled \"Response\" containing a tiny JSON snippet (e.g., {\"temp\":15}).
